Deep Purple - Smoke on The Water

(estrofe 1)
      G5
   We all came out to Montreux
                  F5    G5
   On the lake Geneva shoreline
   To make records with a mobile
F5            G5
   We didn't have much time

   Frank Zappa & the Mothers
                      F5    G5
   Were at the best place around
   But some stupid with a flare gun
                  F5      G5
   Burned the place to the ground.

(refrão)
        C5          Ab5
      Smoke on the water,
       G5
      Fire in the sky
        C5          Ab5
      Smoke on the water

G5
   They burned down the gambling house
                   F5     G5
   It died with an awful sound
   Funky & Claude was running in and out,
F5          G5
   Pulling kids out of the ground

   When it all was over,
                    F5          G5
   We had to find another place
   Swiss time was running out
                            F5            G5
   It seemed that we would lose the race.

        C5          Ab5
      Smoke on the water,
       G5
      Fire in the sky
        C5          Ab5
      Smoke on the water

G5
   We ended up at the Grand Hotel
          F5      G5
   It was empty, cold and bare
   But with the Rolling Trucks Stones thing just outside,
F5              G5
   We made our music there

   With a few red lights an' a few old beds,
               F5       G5
   We made a place to sweat
   No matter what we get out of this,
          F5               G5
   I know,   I know we'll never forget.

      Smoke on the water,
       G5
      Fire in the sky
        C5          Ab5
      Smoke on the water
